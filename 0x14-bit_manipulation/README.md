# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

Welcome to the **0x14. C - Bit Manipulation** repository! This repository contains a series of projects and exercises that dive into the world of bit manipulation in the C programming language. Bit manipulation is a powerful technique that involves working at the individual bit level, enabling you to perform various operations efficiently and optimize code for performance.

## Description

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that cover a range of bit manipulation concepts and challenges. These projects are designed to provide you with hands-on experience and a solid understanding of bitwise operators, shifting, setting and clearing specific bits, and more.

## Projects

Explore the projects included in this repository:

1. **[0-binary_to_uint.c]**: Convert a binary string to an unsigned integer.
2. **[1-print_binary.c]**: Print the binary representation of an integer.
3. **[2-get_bit.c]**: Get the value of a specific bit at an index.
4. **[3-set_bit.c]**: Set a specific bit at an index to 1.
5. **[4-clear_bit.c]**: Clear a specific bit at an index.
6. **[5-flip_bits.c]**: Calculate the number of bits needed to flip to transform one number into another.
7. **[100-get_endianness.c]**: Determine the endianness of the system.
8. **[101-password]**: Cracking a password protected program.

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wisdomsena36/0x14-bit-manipulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x14-bit-manipulation
   ```

3. Explore the project folders and their corresponding source files.

## Usage
