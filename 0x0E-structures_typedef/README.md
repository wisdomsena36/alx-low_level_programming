# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x0E. C - Structures, typedef" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX(Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we explore the concept of structures in C programming. We learn how to define and use structures to create custom data types that can hold multiple variables of different types. We also delve into the concept of `typedef`, which allows us to create aliases for existing data types, making our code more readable and expressive.

The projects in this module provide hands-on experience with structures and typedef. Each project has specific requirements and tasks to complete using the knowledge gained from the lessons.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:

### 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
- **dog.h**: Defines a structure called `dog` with various member variables to represent information about a dog.

- **1-init_dog.c**: Initializes a variable of type `struct dog`.

- **2-print_dog.c**: Prints the contents of a `struct dog` variable.

- **4-new_dog.c**: Creates a new dog by allocating memory and setting its values based on provided input.

- **5-free_dog.c**: Frees the memory allocated for a dog created using `4-new_dog.c`.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
