# 0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x13. C - More Singly Linked Lists" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX(Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we continue to explore the concept of singly linked lists in the C programming language. Singly linked lists are a fundamental data structure that allows us to store and manage data in a dynamic and flexible manner. Building on the concepts from the previous module, we delve deeper into the manipulation and operations on linked lists.

The projects in this module provide hands-on experience with more advanced operations on linked lists, such as inserting nodes at specific positions, reversing the list, and finding the nth node from the end. We also explore the concepts of recursion and advanced pointer manipulation.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:
- **0-print_listint.c**: Defines a function that prints all the elements of a singly linked list of integers.
- **1-listint_len.c**: Defines a function that returns the number of elements in a singly linked list of integers.
- **2-add_nodeint.c**: Defines a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list of integers.
- **3-add_nodeint_end.c**: Defines a function that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list of integers.
- **4-free_listint.c**: Defines a function that frees a singly linked list of integers.
- **5-free_listint2.c**: Defines a function that frees a singly linked list of integers and sets the head to `NULL`.
- **6-pop_listint.c**: Defines a function that deletes the head node of a singly linked list of integers and returns its data.
- **7-get_nodeint.c**: Defines a function that returns the nth node of a singly linked list of integers.
- **8-sum_listint.c**: Defines a function that returns the sum of all the data (integers) in a singly linked list.
- **9-insert_nodeint.c**: Defines a function that inserts a new node at a given position in a singly linked list of integers.
- **10-delete_nodeint.c**: Defines a function that deletes a node at a given position in a singly linked list of integers.
- **100-reverse_listint.c**: Defines a function that reverses a singly linked list of integers.
- **101-print_listint_safe.c**: Defines a function that prints a singly linked list of integers (including infinite loops).
- **102-free_listint_safe.c**: Defines a function that frees a singly linked list of integers (including infinite loops).
- **103-find_loop.c**: Defines a function that finds the loop in a singly linked list.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
