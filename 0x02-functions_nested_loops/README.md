## About

In this repository, you will find various programming tasks that explore the concepts of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. These tasks are designed to help you practice and solidify your understanding of these fundamental concepts.

Each task is contained within its own file, which includes a description of the problem statement and the corresponding C code solution. You can explore the code and review the implementation to gain a deeper understanding of how these concepts are applied.

## Tasks

Here is a list of the tasks included in this repository:

1. **0-putchar.c**: Program that prints "_putchar" followed by a new line.

2. **1-alphabet.c**: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

3. **2-print_alphabet_x10.c**: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase ten times, each on a new line.

4. **3-islower.c**: Function that checks for lowercase characters.

5. **4-isalpha.c**: Function that checks for alphabetic characters.

6. **5-sign.c**: Function that prints the sign of a number.

7. **6-abs.c**: Function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

8. **7-print_last_digit.c**: Function that prints the last digit of a number.

9. **8-24_hours.c**: Function that prints every minute of the day, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

10. **9-times_table.c**: Function that prints the 9 times table, starting from 0.

11. **10-add.c**: Function that adds two integers and returns the result.

12. **11-print_to_98.c**: Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.

13. **100-times_table.c**: Function that prints the n times table, starting from 0 up to a given value.

14. **101-natural.c**: Program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024.

15. **102-fibonacci.c**: Program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2.

16. **103-fibonacci.c**: Program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms in the Fibonacci sequence, which do not exceed 4,000,000.

17. **104-fibonacci.c**: Program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- GCC compiler

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/wisdomsena36/0x02-functions_nested_loops.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```
   cd 0x02-functions_nested_loops
   ```

3. Compile the desired task using the GCC compiler. For example, to compile `0-putchar.c`, run the following command:

   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o putchar 

0-putchar.c
   ```

4. Execute the compiled program:

   ```
   ./putchar
   ```

   You should see the output of the corresponding task.

5. Follow the same steps to compile and execute other tasks in the repository.
