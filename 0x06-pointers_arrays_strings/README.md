# 0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

## Description
This repository contains my solutions to the projects and exercises for the "0x06. C - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings" curriculum of the low-level programming language C. The projects are part of the ALX School's curriculum.

The purpose of this project is to further deepen the understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C. It covers topics such as multidimensional arrays, pointer arithmetic, string manipulation, and more.

## Projects
The repository includes the following projects:

### 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings
This project covers various tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings. Each task is implemented in a separate C file and includes a corresponding header file.

Here are the tasks:
- **0-strcat.c:** A function that concatenates two strings.
- **1-strncat.c:** A function that concatenates two strings, but with a limitation on the number of bytes copied from the source string.
- **2-strncpy.c:** A function that copies a string, but with a limitation on the number of bytes copied.
- **3-strcmp.c:** A function that compares two strings.
- **4-rev_array.c:** A function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
- **5-string_toupper.c:** A function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- **6-cap_string.c:** A function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
- **7-leet.c:** A function that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) language.
- **100-rot13.c:** A function that encodes a string using rot13.
- **101-print_number.c:** A function that prints an integer without using `long`, arrays, or pointers.
- **102-magic.c:** The task requires modifying one line of code to print a[2] = 98.
- **103-infinite_add.c:** A function that adds two numbers stored as strings.
- **104-print_buffer.c:** A function that prints the content of a buffer.

## Getting Started
To access the content of this repository, you can clone it using the following command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wisdomsena36/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings.git
```

After cloning the repository, you can compile the C files using a C compiler, such as GCC, with the following flags:

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o executable_name
```

Replace `executable_name` with the desired name for the resulting executable file.

## Usage
After compiling the C files, you can run the executable file as follows:

```
$ ./executable_name
```

Replace `executable_name` with the name of the compiled file.
