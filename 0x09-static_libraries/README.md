## Description

In this project, we explore the concept of static libraries in C programming. We learn how to create and use static libraries to compile multiple source files into a single executable.

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. **libmy.a**: We create a static library named `libmy.a` that contains various functions defined in separate source files.
2. **create_static_lib.sh**: We write a script that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.

## Usage

Follow the steps below to compile and run the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/wisdomsena36/your_repository
   ```

2. Change to the repository's directory:

   ```shell
   cd your_repository
   ```

3. Compile the C files using the provided scripts:

   For task 1:
   ```shell
   ./compile.sh
   ```

   For task 2:
   ```shell
   ./create_static_lib.sh
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable (if applicable).
