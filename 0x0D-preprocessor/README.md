# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x0D. C - Preprocessor" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX(Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we dive into the world of C preprocessor directives. We learn about macros, include guards, conditional compilation, and more. We explore how the preprocessor can be used to manipulate code before it is compiled, enabling us to optimize and customize our programs.

The projects in this module are designed to provide hands-on experience with preprocessor concepts and techniques. Each project has specific requirements and tasks to complete using the knowledge gained from the lessons.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:

### 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
- **0-object_like_macro.h**: Defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

- **1-pi.h**: Defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

- **2-main.c**: Prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

- **3-function_like_macro.h**: Defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

- **4-sum.h**: Computes the sum of two numbers using a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)`.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
