# 0x0F. C - Function Pointers

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x0F. C - Function Pointers" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX(Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we delve into the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. We learn how to declare, initialize, and use function pointers to create more flexible and dynamic code. Function pointers enable us to pass functions as arguments to other functions, store functions in data structures, and call functions indirectly based on runtime conditions.

The projects in this module provide hands-on experience with function pointers. Each project has specific requirements and tasks to complete using the knowledge gained from the lessons.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:

- **0-print_name.c**: Defines a function that takes a function pointer as a parameter and uses it to print a name.

- **1-array_iterator.c**: Defines a function that takes an array, its size, and a function pointer, and applies the function to each element of the array.

- **2-int_index.c**: Defines a function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer to specify the comparison function.

- **3-calc.h, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-main.c**: Implements a simple calculator program using function pointers to perform various arithmetic operations.

- **100-main_opcodes.c**: Prints the opcodes of its own main function.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
