# 0x10. C - Variadic Functions

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x10. C - Variadic Functions" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX(Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we explore the concept of variadic functions in the C programming language. Variadic functions allow us to define functions that can accept a variable number of arguments at runtime. They provide a flexible way to handle functions with an indefinite number of parameters.

The projects in this module provide hands-on experience with variadic functions. Each project has specific requirements and tasks to complete using the knowledge gained from the lessons.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:

- **0-sum_them_all.c**: Defines a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- **1-print_numbers.c**: Defines a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- **2-print_strings.c**: Defines a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- **3-print_all.c**: Defines a function that prints anything, based on the format specifier provided.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
