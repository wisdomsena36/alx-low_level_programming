# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

## Description
This repository contains projects and exercises that demonstrate the usage of `argc` and `argv` in the C programming language. The projects are part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX (Software Engineering).

The `argc` and `argv` parameters are commonly used in C programs to handle command-line arguments. `argc` represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, while `argv` is an array of strings that holds the actual arguments.

Each project in this repository explores different aspects of `argc` and `argv` and provides hands-on experience in working with command-line arguments in C.

## Projects

### [0-whatsmyname](./0-whatsmyname)
A C program that prints its own name.

### [1-args](./1-args)
A C program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.

### [2-args](./2-args)
A C program that prints all the arguments it receives.

### [3-mul](./3-mul)
A C program that multiplies two numbers.

### [4-add](./4-add)
A C program that adds positive numbers.

### [100-change](./100-change)
A C program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for a given amount.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the repository, you can use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/0x0A-argc_argv.git
```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```
cd 0x0A-argc_argv
```

Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a README file with further instructions on how to compile and run the program.

## Requirements
The projects in this repository have been written in the C programming language and compiled using `gcc`. To compile the programs, make sure you have `gcc` installed on your machine.

## Usage
To compile a C program, use the `gcc` compiler followed by the source file and the output file name. For example:

```
gcc -o output-file source-file.c
```

To run the compiled program, type the name of the output file. For example:

```
./output-file
```
