# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This repository contains exercises and examples related to variables, if-else statements, and while loops in programming.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

- `0-positive_or_negative.c`: This C program checks whether a randomly generated number is positive, negative, or zero.
- `1-last_digit.c`: This C program checks the last digit of a randomly generated number.
- `2-print_alphabet.c`: This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- `3-print_alphabets.c`: This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase and uppercase.
- `4-print_alphabt.c`: This C program prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for 'q' and 'e'.
- `5-print_numbers.c`: This C program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
- `6-print_numberz.c`: This C program prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, using only putchar.
- `7-print_tebahpla.c`: This C program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- `8-print_base16.c`: This C program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- `9-print_comb.c`: This C program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- `10-print_comb2.c`: This C program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.
- `100-print_comb3.c`: This C program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, without repeating digits.
- `101-print_comb4.c`: This C program prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers, without repeating digits.
- `102-print_comb5.c`: This C program prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project, you can use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/wisdomsena36/0x01-variables_if_else_while.git
```

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the C programs in this repository, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

## Compilation and Execution

You can compile a C program using the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_file>
```

For example, to compile `0-positive_or_negative.c`, you can use the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-positive_or_negative.c -o positive_or_negative
```

To execute the compiled program, run the following command:

```
./<output_file>
```

For example, to run `positive_or_negative`, you can use the following command:

```
./positive_or_negative
```
