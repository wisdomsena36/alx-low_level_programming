# 0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x12. C - Singly Linked Lists" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX (Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we dive into the concept of singly linked lists in the C programming language. Linked lists are a fundamental data structure that allows us to store and manage data in a dynamic and flexible manner. We explore the concept of nodes and pointers, which form the building blocks of linked lists.

The projects in this module provide hands-on experience with creating, traversing, and manipulating singly linked lists. We implement various operations on linked lists, such as inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and printing the list elements.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:

- **0-print_list.c**: Defines a function that prints all the elements of a singly linked list.
- **1-list_len.c**: Defines a function that returns the number of elements in a singly linked list.
- **2-add_node.c**: Defines a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
- **3-add_node_end.c**: Defines a function that adds a new node at the end of a singly linked list.
- **4-free_list.c**: Defines a function that frees a singly linked list.
- **100-first.c**: Defines a function that prints a string before the `main` function is executed.
- **101-hello_holberton.asm**: Contains assembly code that prints "Hello, Holberton" using `printf`.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
