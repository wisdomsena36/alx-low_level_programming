# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

This repository contains solutions for the projects of the "0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops" module in the lower-level programming track at ALX(Software Engineering).

## Description
In this module, we continue to explore C programming by introducing more functions and nested loops. Functions allow us to organize code into reusable blocks, making the program structure more organized and maintainable. Nested loops help us iterate over multiple dimensions of data efficiently.

The projects in this module build on the knowledge gained from previous modules and provide hands-on experience with implementing functions, working with nested loops, and solving more complex problems.

## Projects
Here are the projects included in this module:

### 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
- **0-isupper.c**: Defines a function that checks for uppercase letters.
- **1-isdigit.c**: Defines a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
- **2-mul.c**: Defines a function that multiplies two integers.
- **3-print_numbers.c**: Defines a function that prints numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
- **4-print_most_numbers.c**: Defines a function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 (excluding 2 and 4), followed by a new line.
- **5-more_numbers.c**: Defines a function that prints numbers from 0 to 14 ten times, followed by a new line.
- **6-print_line.c**: Defines a function that draws a straight line in the terminal using the character `_`.
- **7-print_diagonal.c**: Defines a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the character `\`.
- **8-print_square.c**: Defines a function that prints a square using the character `#`.
- **9-fizz_buzz.c**: Implements the Fizz-Buzz game.
- **10-print_triangle.c**: Defines a function that prints a right-angled triangle using the character `#`.
- **100-prime_factor.c**: Defines a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143.
- **101-print_number.c**: Defines a function that prints an integer.

## Usage
You can clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to each project's directory to find the corresponding solution files. Compile the C files using an appropriate C compiler according to the project's requirements.

```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
```

Replace `<source_file.c>` with the name of the C file you want to compile and `<output_file>` with the desired name of the executable.
