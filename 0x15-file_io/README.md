# 0x15. C - File I/O

This repository encompasses solutions to a range of programming tasks centered around File Input/Output in the C programming language. These tasks were integral components of the ALX (Software Engineering) curriculum, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of file manipulation, reading and writing data from and to files, and proficiently navigating file descriptors in the C programming environment.

## Project Description

In this project, we explore the concepts of File Input/Output in the C programming language. File I/O is a crucial aspect of many software applications, enabling data persistence and interaction with external files. The tasks in this repository cover various aspects of working with files, such as reading data from files, writing data to files, manipulating file pointers, and more.

## Project File

1. **0-read_textfile.c**: Program that reads a text file and prints its content to the standard output.
2. **1-create_file.c**: Program that creates a file with specific content.
3. **2-append_text_to_file.c**: Program that appends text to the end of a file.
4. **3-cp.c**: Program that copies the content of one file to another file.
5. **100-elf_header.c**: Program that displays the information contained in the ELF header of an ELF file.

Each C file contains the implementation for the respective task along with comments explaining the logic and approach used to accomplish the task.

## Usage

To use any of the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x15-c-file-io.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired task directory:
   ```
   cd 0x15-c-file-io/task-directory
   ```

3. Compile the C file using your preferred C compiler. For example:
   ```
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic task-file.c -o task-executable
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./task-executable
   ```

## Compilation

The programs are meant to be compiled using a C compiler like `gcc`. The compilation process involves providing the source code file as input and generating an executable output file. The compilation command typically follows this format:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic source-file.c -o executable-name
```

The flags used here enable additional warnings and ensure a stricter adherence to C programming standards.
